Tests:

1) The initialization function must send the command 0x9f over SPI.

2) The initialization function must return "issi25lp064_OK" if the 
memory responds with ID 0x9d.

3) The initialization function must return "issi25lp064_ERROR" if the 
memory responds with an ID different than 0x9d.

4) A read to address 0x1234 should send the command <0x03001234> to memory
over SPI.

5) If 100 bytes are deleted from address 0x1000 (affects one sector) the following 
commands must be sent to memory over SPI.

 a) read status                   : 0x05
 b) write enable                  : 0x06
 c) erase sector at address 0x1000: 0xd7001000
 d) read status                   : 0x05

6) Before sending the delete command to the memory, it must be verified that the memory 
is not busy doing another operation. If the memory is busy, its status should be 
asked until it answers that it is not busy.

 a) read status                   : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 b) read status                   : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 c) read status                   : 0x05
 d) write enable                  : 0x06
 e) erase sector at address 0x1000: 0xd7001000
 f) read status                   : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 g) read status                   : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 h) read status                   : 0x05
 
7) If 8193 bytes (affects three sectors) are deleted from address 0x1000 the following 
commands must be sent to memory over SPI.
 
 a) read status                   : 0x05
 b) write enable                  : 0x06
 c) erase sector at address 0x1000: 0xd7001000
 d) read status                   : 0x05

 e) read status                   : 0x05
 f) write enable                  : 0x06
 g) erase sector at address 0x2000: 0xd7002000
 h) read status                   : 0x05
  
 i) read status                   : 0x05
 j) write enable                  : 0x06
 k) erase sector at address 0x3000: 0xd7003000
 l) read status                   : 0x05

8) A write of 10 bytes to address 0x1234 must send the following commands to memory.
 
 a) read status                 : 0x05
 b) write enable                : 0x06
 c) write page at address 0x1200: 0x02001200 + data
 d) read status                 : 0x05


9) Before sending the write page command to the memory, it must be verified that the memory 
is not busy doing another operation. If the memory is busy, its status should be asked until 
it answers that it is not busy.
 
 a) read status                 : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 b) read status                 : 0x05 (receive busy state) 
 c) read status                 : 0x05
 d) write enable                : 0x06
 e) write page at address 0x1200: 0x02001200 + data
 f) read status                 : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 g) read status                 : 0x05 (receive busy state)
 h) read status                 : 0x05
